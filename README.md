Rossman store sales analysis and pridiction

Project Objective is to build and serve an end-to-end product that delivers this prediction to analysts in the finance team.

Task 1 - Exploration of customer purchasing behavior
In this task, we seek to explore the behavior of customers in the various stores. The goal is to check how some measures such as promos and the opening of new stores affect purchasing behavior.

Project Goals

    Data Exploration and Cleaning: Thoroughly understand the dataset, identify potential issues, and clean the data for analysis.
    Feature Engineering: Create new features or transform existing ones to improve predictive power.
    Model Selection and Training: Experiment with various machine learning algorithms to find the best model for this task.
    Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the chosen model using appropriate metrics.
    Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize the model's performance by fine-tuning its hyperparameters.
